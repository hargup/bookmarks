* [Proposal to close Siberian
  Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Siberian_Wikipedia).
This is discussion is particular interesting because of its political nature and
how it is being played out in Wikipedia's context.

* [Proposal to close Old English Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Old_English_Wikipedia). Old English is a "dead" language, yet there are more than 2500 articles on it. It kinds of delights me to see people engaging in such projects just for fun of it.

* [Wikimedia Tool Labs](http://tools.wmflabs.org/)

* [http://www.sit.iitkgp.ernet.in/Meghamala/index.html](http://www.sit.iitkgp.ernet.in/Meghamala/team.html) IIT Kharagpur's cloud service, I'll probably want to use it in future.
